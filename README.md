## React Tic-tac-toe
This game allows the user to play tic-tac-toe, and at the completion of the game, a winner is declared.
<br>
Find the tutorial I followed [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#before-we-start-the-tutorial).

## Getting Started
Run `npm start`
<br>
The app will open on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), where you can view it in the browser.

## Tech Stack
This game demonstrates the ability to use React concepts, including elements, components, props, and state.

## MVP
PHASE ONE
<li>Create a table consisting of 9 squares where each square will 'remember' the value it holds by using state.</li>
<br>
PHASE TWO
<li>Modify the components to alternate the value of each square: null, O, or X.</li>
<br>
PHASE THREE
<li>Display winner at the end of each game.</li>
<br>

## Instructions for Futur Development
This React tutorial includes adding "Time Travel" to the game, where the user can see their past moves.
<br>
There are additional opportunities to:
<ul>
 <li>Add highlighting to the row that has won</li>
 <li>Display the location of each move</li>
 <li>Bold selected item on the moves list</li>
 <li>Rewrite the Board using two loops to make the squares instead of hard coding them</li>
 <li>Add a toggle to show moves in ascending or descending order</li>
 <li>Add logic to declare a draw</li>
 <li>Make the code more modular by importing and exporting different components</li>
</ul>
